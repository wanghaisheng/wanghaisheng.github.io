从qq到校内网，再到科学网，再到hexo，再到微信和公众号，过去的十多年里我留下了诸多互联网记忆，这次希望能把他们都汇总起来，呈现一个立体的我自己，希望能交到新朋友。

曾几何时，幻想着自己能文思如尿奔，写一些生活的感悟，记录一些成长的足迹，辗转从qq空间到chinaunix再到科学网，种种不适，最终在这里落脚。

这里是海生(edwin)的小窝，记录着海生成长过程中的酸甜苦辣。虽努力地想让大家看到、了解、认识真实的自己，海生却不如自己所想的那般勇敢和自信，这其中或多或少是由于天生的那点自尊、自恋和自卑在作祟。文字总是唯美的，我可爱的朋友们，希望你们能够从这些拙劣的话语中找到一丝丝温暖，感受到一丝丝温馨.如果看了我的碎碎念之后,你有要说话的冲动，请不要过分珍惜你的键盘或者是我的空间 －－ 因为，你是我的朋友。"
