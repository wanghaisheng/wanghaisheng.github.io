I value teams that foster open communication, support continuous learning, and prioritize the ethical implications of AI in healthcare.

#### Project I'm Proud Of
**Project: Medical Self-service Cloud Platform**
##### **Background**:
Nine years ago, our company was a leading vendor of self-service kiosks in China, deployed in numerous hospitals across the country. Each hospital faced unique challenges in data collection and report management, particularly concerning lab reports and diagnostic data. The diversity in report formats and terminologies made it difficult to standardize data presentation across our kiosk network.

Traditionally, obtaining data from hospitals relied heavily on vendor-provided interfaces. This approach was fraught with issues:

- High Costs: The cost of acquiring and maintaining these interfaces was substantial.
- Quality and Reliability Issues: Interface documentation was often inadequate or unreliable, leading to inconsistencies and technical difficulties.
- Long Implementation Cycles: The integration process was time-consuming, with extended implementation periods that hindered rapid deployment and responsiveness.
To address these challenges, we decided to adopt a more innovative approach using RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to streamline data extraction and integration.

##### **Motivation**:
Our goal was to enhance user accessibility to medical information via mobile apps and self-service kiosks while overcoming the limitations of traditional data integration methods. We aimed to improve both the technical and commercial aspects of data handling, ensuring a more efficient and cost-effective solution.

##### **Technical Details**:python+c+nginx+lua+ceph

##### **Challenges in Implementation**:

- High Costs and Quality Issues with Traditional Interfaces: Vendor-provided interfaces were expensive and unreliable, leading us to explore alternative solutions.
- Complex Report Formats: Diverse and inconsistent report layouts posed significant obstacles to standardization.

**Adoption of RPA and Advanced OCR**:

- RPA for Data Extraction: Implemented RPA to automate the data extraction process, bypassing the need for costly and unreliable vendor interfaces. This approach allowed us to efficiently collect and process data from a wide range of report formats without relying on traditional integration methods.
- Direct Parsing of PDF and XPS Files: Developed capabilities to directly handle structured PDF and XPS files, which simplified data extraction for well-defined formats.
- Innovative OCR Solutions: For unstructured files, introduced an intermediate format capturing each character and its spatial coordinates. This facilitated more accurate layout analysis and data extraction, addressing the limitations of traditional OCR methods.
- Technological Advancements: Transitioned from traditional OCR algorithms to advanced techniques using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. This leap in technology significantly improved accuracy and efficiency in data processing.

**Business and Technical Integration**:

- Intermediate Format Development: Created a standardized intermediate format for character mapping and spatial coordinates, enhancing the precision of layout analysis and data extraction.
- Cost and Time Efficiency: By leveraging RPA and advanced OCR technologies, we reduced integration timelines from months to weeks and lowered implementation costs, making the solution more commercially viable.
- Enhanced User Experience: Improved the accessibility and presentation of medical reports via mobile apps and kiosks, resulting in a better user experience and higher adoption rates.
  
##### Personal Contribution:
As a leading contributor:

- RPA Implementation: Spearheaded the adoption and deployment of RPA for efficient data extraction, bypassing traditional interface challenges.
