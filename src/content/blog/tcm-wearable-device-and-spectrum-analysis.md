Research Plan: Health Monitoring and Integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Using Wearable Devices and Spectrum Analysis


## Background



With advancements in technology, wearable devices play an increasingly important role in health monitoring. These devices can continuously track various physiological signals, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose, providing convenience for personal health management. However, extracting meaningful health information from vast amounts of data remains a focus for researchers.



In the field of machine fault diagnosis, sensors collect vibration and temperature signals, and techniques like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) effectively identify potential faults by decomposing signals into different frequency components. We propose a novel approach: using physiological signals collected by wearable devices and spectrum analysis techniques to explore indicators related to the five organ systems in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)—the liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney.



This research aims to establish a quantitative assessment method for human organ system health, enabling early detection of health issues and promoting the development of personalized medicine.



## Method Overview



### Formation and Analysis of Data Curves



1. Spectrum Analysis:

  - Utilize FFT and other techniques to decompose PPG and ECG signals into different frequency components, extracting features related to TCM organ systems to form five data curves[1].



2. Trend Recording:

  - Long-term Monitoring: Continuously record the trends of the five data curves corresponding to the liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney to identify potential health issues.

  - Circadian Rhythm Analysis: Analyze variations in physiological signals across different times of day to evaluate their impact on organ function.



3. Inter-organ Correlation Analysis:

  - Investigate the positive and negative correlations between data curves of different organ systems to explore their interactions.



4. Yin-Yang Balance Exploration:

  - Establish a quantitative model to assess the state of Yin-Yang balance, exploring how imbalances manifest in physiological indicators.



### Exploration of Positive and Negative Correlations and Interactions



1. Correlation Analysis:

  - Analyze the positive and negative relationships between organ systems, establishing models of mutual support and restriction.



2. Quantitative Yin-Yang Balance Model:

  - Attempt to build a model to assess the Yin-Yang balance, considering the interactions among organ system data curves.



3. Yin-Yang Interpretation of Physiological Changes:

  - Investigate scientific explanations for physiological changes during Yin-Yang imbalances.



## Further Directions



- Clinical Validation: Test the accuracy and practicality of the model in clinical settings.

- Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Work with TCM experts to deepen the understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind Yin-Yang balance.

- Personalized Medicine: Develop personalized health monitoring and intervention strategies.



## Updated Research Plan



### Phase 1: Preparation Stage (1-2 months)

- Define research design and methodology.

- Conduct literature review.

- Submit ethical review.

- Recruit study participants.



### Phase 2: Data Collection Stage (3-6 months)

- Equip participants with wearable devices and collect data.

- Ensure data synchronization and quality control.



### Phase 3: Spectrum Analysis and Data Curve Formation Stage (7-9 months)

- Analyze signals using spectrum analysis and extract features.

- Formulate the five corresponding data curves.

- Record trends, including circadian rhythm analysis.



### Phase 4: Yin-Yang Balance and Correlation Analysis Stage (10-12 months)

- Analyze trends in data curves.

- Study correlations between organ systems.



### Phase 5: Algorithm Development and Validation Stage (13-15 months)

- Develop or optimize algorithms.

- Validate the accuracy and reliability of research findings.



### Phase 6: Summary and Reporting Stage (16-18 months)

- Summarize data analysis.

- Write research reports and academic papers.

- Engage in academic exchanges and dissemination of findings.



## Expected Outcomes



- Establish a normative model of TCM organ systems based on wearable devices.

- Explore quantitative methods for assessing Yin-Yang balance.

- Promote the modernization of integrating TCM with Western medicine.



## Ethical Considerations



- Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines to protect participants' privacy and data security.

- All participants will sign informed consent forms, with data anonymized.
